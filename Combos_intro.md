# Intro to Combos
Say you have a few Arrays of different objects, 
and were tasked with finding out reliable way to work out the
different possible combination of things you have in that array.  

Lets see some examples:

## Pairing
For this instance, I am going to illustrate things with Three Sample Arrays that you have
```ruby
words = %w[a b c]
numbs = [1,2,3]
chars = ['#','!']
````

more examples will follow

### Power Pair
### Serial Pair
### Random Pair
#### Repeatable Random

### Combo Pair
