## Synopsis
Thanks for trying out my Ruby Combinator. Hope it serves your purpose!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'combos'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install combos

## Usage

There is comprehensive documentation added to Combos_intro.md  
More info may be added to the Wiki in the future, as needed.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.  
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.  
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.  
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
